### yo 👋  
i’m **Semmy** i build stuff for the web. mostly focused on making digital experiences actually *work* — fast, secure and not boring.  

kinda a jack-of-all-trades. I help brands pull off things they didn’t even know were possible.  

been spending some time messing around with [**Cybrance**](https://cybrance.nl) a bot hosting platform i’m building whenever i feel like it.

🛠️ usually messing around with:  
- next.js / react / node  
- random backend magic  
- making security not suck
